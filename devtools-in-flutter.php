<h2>How Do you use DevTools in Flutter?</h2>

As the name suggests, DevTools is primarily a tool. In addition, it lets us know the performance of the app. And besides that, it also helps us in debugging.

All together, Flutter or Dart DevTools is very handy. However, as a developer, you must know how to use it.

First of all, to open DevTools you need to run your app first. Then you'll click the DevTools link so that it opens either in Chrome or Mozilla browser.

In Visual Studio Code Editor at the bottom right corner you will find the DevTools. Watch the next image.

<h2>What is Flutter tool?</h2>
People often find it ambiguous and confuse flutter with DevTools. Certainly, both are tools all the same they are not equal in meaning.

On the contrary, Flutter is a UI software tool kit, whereas DevTools gives you support regarding the application you make with Flutter.

Now, question is what can we do with the help of DevTools?

On the left side we can see the emulator. And on the right side the DevTools shows the app structure. Since we've clicked the OutLinedButton, it gives us all the details about the button.

Moreover, it inspects the whole UI layout and gives us details of the state of flutter app.

DevTools is the answer. In addition, the next image will show you three different types of bars. Moreover, these bars in the DevTools will show you how the app performs.

The Jank performance issues come with slow frame that makes your app slower.

Although our target is to make the app as faster as possible, still we need to check it always. In the above image the bars in red-accent colors are all jank frames.

Besides CPU or Network profiling, you can debug memory issues by watching this full report.

These are main advantages of DevTools.
